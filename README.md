# Graph-Implementation
This is an implementation of a graph with many properties. The Dijkstra Algorithm is also implemented within it.

Graph in this implementation can be:
- weighted/unweighted
- directed/indirected
- with multiple edges / without

Available operations with graph:
- insert a vertex
- insert an edge
- set weight to the edge (if the graph is weighted)
- calculate the distance from a given vertex to all the other (using the Dijkstra algorithm)
- delete the vertex
- delete the edge
- print the graph (in a form of adjacency lists)
